Coin Contour Detection 🚀
Overview 📸
This Python script processes a grayscale image of coins from the scikit-image dataset, detects contours of coins using edge detection and morphological operations, filters them by area, and draws the filtered contours on the original image. The result is saved as a PNG file, and the number of detected contours is printed to the console. 💰✨
Requirements 🛠️

Python 3.x
Libraries:
numpy: For array operations 📊
opencv-python (cv2): For image processing and contour detection 🖼️
scikit-image: For loading the test image (coins) 🔍



Install dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-image

Usage ▶️

Ensure all required libraries are installed. ✅
Run the script:python coins_contour_detection.py


The script will:
Load the coins image from scikit-image. 📥
Apply Canny edge detection, thresholding, and morphological closing. ⚙️
Detect and filter contours by area (between 200 and 5000 pixels). 🧹
Draw green contours on the original image and save it as res.png. 🎨
Print the number of detected contours to the console. 🖥️



Code Explanation 💡

Input: Grayscale coins image from scikit-image (304x400 pixels). 🪙
Processing Steps:
Edge Detection: Uses Canny edge detector (thresholds: 50, 150). 🔍
Thresholding: Applies Otsu's method for binarization. 📊
Morphological Operation: Performs closing with a 3x3 kernel to reduce noise. 🧽
Contour Detection: Finds external contours using OpenCV's findContours. 🗺️
Filtering: Keeps contours with area between 200 and 5000 pixels. 📏
Visualization: Draws filtered contours in green on the original image. 🌟


Output:
res.png: Image with green contours around detected coins. 🖼️
Console output: Number of filtered contours (e.g., ~27 for the coins image). 📢



Notes ⚠️

The original code contains a syntax error in the contour filtering loop (incorrect indentation of the if statement). Ensure proper indentation for correct execution. 🐛
The input image is grayscale; drawing colored contours requires converting it to BGR format (cv.cvtColor(imgray, cv.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)) for proper color display. 🎨
Uncommented cv.imwrite lines can be used for debugging intermediate results (e.g., edges, thresholded image). 🔧
Adjust min_area and max_area to fine-tune contour filtering for different images. 🔄

Limitations 🚧

The script assumes the input image is grayscale and may not handle colored images correctly without modification. 🌈
No error handling for cases like empty contour lists or file I/O issues. ❌
Parameters (Canny thresholds, kernel size, area bounds) are tuned for the coins image and may need adjustment for other datasets. ⚙️

Example Output 🌟

Console: Prints the number of detected coins (e.g., 27). 📊
File: res.png with green contours around coins. 🪙
